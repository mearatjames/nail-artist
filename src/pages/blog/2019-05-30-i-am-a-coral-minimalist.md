## Here Comes March..

March has been a complete write-off for me in terms of trying to hit my usual blogging goal of 15-20 posts a month. It started out alright, but all in all it has just been really tiring on the day job half of my life and I have been struggling to stay awake after coming home from work. These nails were tough to do as I had already fallen asleep for the night, but knowing that my girls Renee and Trysh had their nails done for today motivated me to at least do SOMETHING! Coral was still our theme for today, so I went through my many many untried polishes and found Dior Smile* which seemed like both a great colour and apt polish name for the start of the week!

I am pretty sure I saw this design on Pinterest somewhere and I would link it for you, but I cannot for the life of me find it in my boards, but I did not come up with this on my own and would gladly give credit to the original poster if I could!

All I needed was two coats of Dior Smile which actually has a very slight shimmer to it. For the dots, I just took a dotting tool and a nail art striper brush, dipped them in black polish and did 'em dots and lines! I sealed everything in with top coat (because why WOULDN'T you?).

I had a verrry long day today filled with some fun and not-so-fun things that I will be dealing with well into next week so I wish everyone the best for the week and hopefully you'll see me again on here within the week!
