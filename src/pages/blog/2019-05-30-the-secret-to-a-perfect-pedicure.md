While the weather allows, it’s great to show off you flawlessly manicured toe nails in open shoes or sandals. Plus, if you’re going on a beach vacation or planning on spending this weekend by the pool, a perfect pedicure is simply obligatory!

While there are so many amazing feet treatments, soaks and next level machines that can add up to a serious spa pedicure at home experience, I leave it for another post.

For now, here are my two top tips for the perfect pedicure:

1. **Well groomed cuticles.** The same principles and cuticle removal technique applies, as for nails (read more about cuticle care). I like using ORLY Cutique to smooth and remove dry bits of skin. It works wonders even on rough toe nail skin!
2. **Flawless application.** If you’re doing your pedicure yourself, it’s difficult (read: impossible) to apply nail polish or gel perfectly on those tiny toe nails. But! You can easily fix it by cleaning up application mistakes with an angled brush dipped in acetone. I use 04 Slayer brush – it’s so sharp and thin it allows to clean perfectly even around the tiniest toes.
