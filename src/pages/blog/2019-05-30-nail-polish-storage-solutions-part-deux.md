It’s been a while now where i’ve had my nail polish stored in various places. Not much rhyme or reason to how they were stored. I had drawers of nail polish separated by manufacturer but even that was becoming a mess. Things were just getting way out of hand and i decided it was time to re-organize everything!

# Separate and Organize

I started by emptying all my drawers and shelves, making piles separated by color. 

I started with my blues and greens and put them on the shelves but didn’t like the way the nail polish looked all mixed up with different manufacturers such as Zoya, Essie, KBShimmer all jumbled up together.

I decided to go further and separate each color by manufacturer. This was starting to look way better!

Since separating my nail polish by brand and by color i have found it so much easier to walk into my bathroom and pick out a shade. Plus it looks so amazing!

Of course this isn’t the finished product. I still have a ton of nail polish that has yet to make it on the walls because i ran out of shelf space! Home Depot no longer carries this exact shelf in 36″ in white anymore, but i was able to figure out the manufacturer which is Woodland

Luckily I found out that Walmart.com sells them through Hayneedle.com for $20.58, so i plan on ordering the remaining 3 shelves to finish off my walls. 

Right now i can fit 1- 36″ shelf on the far left and 2-3 – 36″ shelves on the bottom middle row.

Anywhoo… if you’re looking to mount your nail polish collections on the wall here’s the links to what i would suggest.
