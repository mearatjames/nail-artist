![Prim + Popper](/images/blue-daisy-flower-nail-art-2-.jpg "Prim + Popper")

I took a few days off this week to essentially clean up the apartment and get my home life back and track. As I mentioned before, when work life is productive, I never seem to have the energy for home life, but I was thinking to myself this morning that if I didn't blog my days off would be more free to do the housework that I don't seem to have time to do more regularly. Without blogging though, I would be a most unhappy individual and the overall joy I feel from being surrounded by beauty products is well worth it so as I write this, I am soaking some long overdue hand-washing (I despise hand-washing dresses and sweaters) and finally ticking my first house-related chore off the list! When people ask me how I have time to do my nails even just once a week (I can't believe I used to paint them 2-3x before!), I legit have to make time...like at 12am sometimes which is what happened with these nails because my husband and I ended up watching the movie "Booksmart" last night (it was ok).

I spotted this Pin while cruising Pinterest for inspiration and thought it might be a cute idea to try for our #CBBxManiMonday flower theme this month. For my base colour, I used two coats of London Drugs house brand Prim + Proper in Bri-Tan-ia\*, which could be a one coater really, and then dotted on the flowers using Prim + Proper Powder Fresh\* and Sally Hansen Sunset Orange\* for the centers. I had originally used a yellow polish for the centers, but against the white petals they just didn't \*pop* enough.

I added some leaves by mixing together green and white acrylic paint and then hand-painting in the spaces between the flowers. One coat of top coat and then I was good! I decided to go with a glossy top coat instead of the matte one like in the Pin because I've just never been a matte girl when it comes to nails UNLESS I decide to to Pac Man nails again!
