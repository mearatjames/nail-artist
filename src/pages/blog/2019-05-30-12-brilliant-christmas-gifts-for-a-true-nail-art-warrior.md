I strongly believe that a great gift doesn’t need to cost a fortune. While I strive to give the best presents I can, I also like to keep it reasonable ;)



Quality over quantity is my main rule when shopping, which applies for Christmas presents too. The best option is to gift something from a luxury beauty range or fashion jewellery. You can never go wrong with a Chanel lacquer or trendy pearl earrings. Even though they’re luxury items, they cost less than $35. Christmas is the magical time when all dreams come true, so let’s spoil our loved ones (or yourself!) with wonderful treats.



Be inspired by this selection of fabulous yet affordable Christmas gifts!
