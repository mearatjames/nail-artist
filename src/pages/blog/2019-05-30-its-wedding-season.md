## Nailed It!

I know I'm one day late for this, but I started typing this post really late last night and after what I can only say was "not a positive day" at work, my husband told me to come to bed and get some sleep! Last week our little group of ladies who dutifully paint our nails once a week celebrated ONE YEAR of sticking with our #ManiMondays! I think Trysh was probably the only one who kept up with it every single Monday as I know I took a one week break while I was on vacation in the Fall, but missing 51 out of 52 Mondays ain't half bad! For today and next week, we will be practicing our wedding themed nail art skills as wedding season is upon us so get ready to see lots of pink and lace! For me, bridal nails always involve either a French manicure or glitter gradient and since glitter is way more sexy, I went with that for this week's manicure!

## Add Some Glitter!

Glitter gradients were one of the first "nail arts" I learned how to do and they still remain a solid go-to especially when I want to showcase a glitter, but not slather my entire nail with it. For this girly set of wedding nails, I started off with two coats of OPI Getting Nadi on My Honeymoon\*, from the OPI Fiji collection two years ago, and then grabbed the chunky glitter Burberry Silver Glitter in No. 453\* to get my gradient going. I actually practiced with two other glitters on my right hand that didn't quite make the cut before settling on this one (yes, that's what the right hand is for!).

Add some top coat, possibly even two coats to smooth out the chunkiness of the glitter and I was good to go!
