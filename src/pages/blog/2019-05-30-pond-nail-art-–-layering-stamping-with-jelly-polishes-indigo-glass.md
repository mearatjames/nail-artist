Today I have a quick post for you to let you know that there is a new video on my YouTube channel. Pond nail art was on my to-do list for a while, so when I got the beautiful Glass polishes from Indigo Nails, I knew I had to make one.

I started off by applying one layer of Paris Blue. Then I’ve sprinkled some Holo Effect Indigo on still wet gel. Just a little bit of glitter is enough. It’s important not to apply too much glitter, as you will end up with too much texture. Once the glitter was there, I’ve cured the nails. When the nail was cured I did the first layer of stamping.

At this point, your nails might look a bit funky and weird, but don’t get discouraged, because the next step is going to make the magic happen. Apply a layer of Nostradamus (jelly gel polish from the Glass collection) over the stamping and cure. Now, it’s time for our final stamping. Try stamping the final layer of snowflakes in between the first layer. The first snowflakes should still be visible.
